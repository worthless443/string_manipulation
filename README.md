# Overview 

Reversing the `fmtlib` or c++20 `std::format`, on the partial, also a wrapper using cURLpp to request google gsuide APIs. A very personal project, mainly geared towards learning both the curlpp API and string manipulation alike. 
### String Manipulation 

This name is incomprehensive of the actual objective of this repo. Be assured though, this code gonna be at its premitie state for long, and be open to laugh and cringe at the code and design as much as you want. Again, this is not an organized project but in future, I hope to make it usefull for myself.

see `void example();` to see examples.

### Build 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PatxiofromAlphensign/string_manipulation.git
cd string_manipulation
make && ./strmpl
```
expected result is `0`, runtime error else wise

###TODO  

* Add to, expand and organize `design::util__::reqs` 
* add http POST header options and to follow redirects 
* Add SSL
